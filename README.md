## Hi there 👋
Hi, I'm Kyler!

I graduated in May 2025 with a bachelor's in Management Information Systems from the University of Arizona. I am currently enrolled in a master's degree in MIS with a concentration in information security & assurance with a May 2026 graduation, also from University of Arizona. 

Last summer (2025) I completed a cybersecurity internship at a financial institution.

I am passionate about using AI and automation tools to make security practices more accurate and efficient. I love to learn and pursue projects outside of work and school. Reach out, I would love to connect with you!
